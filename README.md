This program converts Windows 8.1 to Windows 8 Release Preview (also known as Windows 8 Release Candidate or Windows 8 Build 8400) by applying a theme to Windows 8.1, as well as installing additional programs and replacing some system files with ones of Windows 8 RP and RTM, to make Windows 8.1 look and behave almost like this pre-release version of Windows 8.
